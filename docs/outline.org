#+title: Outline

* Abstract

* Introduction
+ What problem am I analyzing?
+ What will this paper encompass?
  + Evaluation of a variety of sorting algorithms from a practical perspective.
  + Proposed hybrid algorithms that perform better than glibc.
  + Discussion of theoretical performance versus reality.
  + Analysis of caches and other performance metrics
  + Experimental setup; variety of systems, ARCC, valgrind, etc.
  + What is my algorithm?
  + Why is it fast and better than the existing standard library implementation?

* Sorting Algorithms
+ Quicksort
+ Insertion sort (basic, fast, binary, etc.)
+ Shell
+ Network (n <= 6)
