  abstractNote    = {The Beartooth Compute Environment (Beartooth) is a high
                  performance computing (HPC) cluster that offers over 500
                  compute nodes and 1.2 PB of storage, with an expected uptime
                  of 98%, allowing researchers to perform computation-intensive
                  analyses on datasets of various sizes. Beartooth can be
                  securely accessed anywhere, anytime using SSH connectivity
                  with UWyo two-factor authentication.},
