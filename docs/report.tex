\section{INTRODUCTION}

Most applications require data to be arranged in a certain order. The procedure
of reordering data according to some comparator is called sorting. Sorting can
be found in nearly every computer system today. From databases to payment
processing systems, data is constantly being sorted. The near omnipresent need
for performant sorting implementations has resulted in all major programming
languages including a generic sorting function within their standard libraries.
These standard implementations can use a variety of algorithms internally, such
as Quicksort, Mergesort, and many others (\todocite), however, rarely does a
single algorithm perform exceptionally well. Often, these algorithms are paired
with one or more other sorting algorithms to offer sizeable performance
benefits. These hybrid algorithms include some tuneable parameters, such as when
to switch from one sorting algorithm to another. While these hybridized
algorithms have varying space and time complexities, their actual performance in
real-world scenarios is rarely formally examined, and the values for these
various parameters are often chosen arbitrarily by the developer. This paper
aims to analyze a wide variety of sorting algorithm implementations across
varying system architectures to determine optimal parameter configurations for
hybrid sorting algorithms. This paper also proposes a new, performant standard
sorting implementation for GNU's C standard library.
